# Hey there üëã  

I'm your go-to guy for **automating anything and everything**.  
I work daily with tools like **n8n**, **Make.com**, and **GoHighLevel**.  

‚ö° If it saves time and clicks, I'm all in.  
I love fixing messy workflows and turning them into smooth, automated systems.  

No fluff, just clean logic and reliable results.

### üöÄ What I Do
- Need leads routed automatically? ‚úÖ Done.  
- Need to connect apps that "don't talk"? ‚úÖ I'll make them talk.  
- Built **full client journeys in GHL** (from form to follow-up).  
- Connected **dozens of APIs** inside Make and n8n.  
- Handled **custom webhooks, scheduling, reminders**, and more.  
- Automated calendars, sales pipelines, and multi-step workflows across platforms.  
- Integrated **legacy systems** into modern setups.  

I believe in setting up **systems that just work**.
